Symfony support policy
======================

As indicated by the contraints defined in the `composer.json` file, this bundle
supports Symfony ~2.3|~3.0.

It means that all the version from 2.3.0 to 3.x.x can be installed. Despite that
fact, only the versions still actively maintained by the Symfony core team or
the LTS ones will be supported by the maintainers of this bundle.

You can check if a given Symfony version is still supported by visiting [their
Roadmap page](http://symfony.com/roadmap).

To sum-up, this bundle:

 * supports all the LTS since 2.3 ;
 * supports all the versions still actively maintained ;
 * tolerates all the versions allowed by the constraints defined in
   `composer.json`.


## That was it!
